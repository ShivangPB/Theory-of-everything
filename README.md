### Indexing
Indexing before alignment

Indexing is an essential step in many bioinformatics applications, as it can greatly reduce the computational time and resources required for sequence alignment. It allows the alignment algorithm to quickly locate the query sequences in the reference genome, without having to search the entire genome for matches. Indexing a genome can be explained similar to indexing a book. If you want to know on which page a certain word appears or a chapter begins, it is much more efficient/faster to look it up in a pre-built index than going through every page of the book until you found it. Same goes for alignments. Indices allow the aligner to narrow down the potential origin of a query sequence within the genome, saving both time and memory.

Indexing a genome assembly involves creating a data structure that allows for efficient access and retrieval of information from the genome sequence. This process is crucial for several reasons:

#### What is Indexing of a Genome Assembly?

Indexing of a genome assembly typically involves the following steps:

1. **Breaking Down the Genome**: The genome sequence is divided into smaller, manageable pieces, often referred to as k-mers (short sequences of length k).
2. **Creating Index Structures**: Data structures such as suffix trees, suffix arrays, hash tables, or Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) are built from these pieces. These structures enable quick search and retrieval operations.
3. **Mapping**: Indexing also involves creating maps of reads or sequences against the reference genome to facilitate rapid identification of where specific sequences or variations occur.

#### Why is Indexing Important?

1. **Speeding Up Searches**: Indexing dramatically reduces the time required to find specific sequences within the genome. Without indexing, searching a sequence in a large genome would require scanning through the entire genome, which is computationally expensive.

2. **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Indexed genomes allow for quick retrieval of relevant data, which is essential for various genomic analyses, such as identifying genetic variants, mapping reads from sequencing experiments, and comparing different genomes.

3. **Enabling Large-Scale Analyses**: Genomic datasets are vast, often consisting of billions of base pairs. Indexing makes it feasible to handle and analyze these large datasets efficiently, supporting large-scale studies such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and population genetics.

4. **Supporting Bioinformatics Tools**: Many bioinformatics tools and software rely on indexed genomes to function effectively. For example, tools for read alignment (like BWA, Bowtie) and variant calling (like GATK) use indexed genomes to quickly map sequencing reads to the reference genome.

5. **Memory and Storage Efficiency**: Indexed structures can be designed to be memory-efficient, allowing large genomes to be processed on systems with limited resources. Techniques like BWT-based indexing (used in tools like BWA) provide compact representations of the genome.
